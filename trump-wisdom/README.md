Didn't really care about the quality of code as soon as I got it to work.

You are welcome to send a PR with more messages, refactoring or anything else.

To get it working you should have a file in the director called `token`

Put the following content in file named token.

<client_id>,<client_secret>,<AppID>
```
git clone <project_url>
npm install
#do the token thing
node index.js
```


I agree that this is not the best documentation, you are welcome to send a PR or I'll do a better documentation whenever I get some time.

Thanks.
